                <p>For the past week, I’ve been using a new system to manage my work as a full-time engineer, a solopreneur, and an antique seller—and let me tell you, it’s working like a charm.</p><p>Before this, I struggled with to-do lists. Either they were too simple and led to chaos, or they were overcomplicated and became more of a burden than a tool. But after years of trial and error, I think I’ve finally cracked the code.</p><hr>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-traditional-to-do-lists">The Problem with Traditional To-Do Lists</h2>
<p>At first, I tried a basic to-do list. Just a simple list of tasks. Sounds great, right?</p><ul>
<li>Day 1: Everything gets done. Perfect.</li>
<li>Day 2: Almost everything gets done. Still fine.</li>
<li>Day 3 and beyond: Unfinished tasks start accumulating. The backlog grows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, the system collapses under the weight of all the unchecked boxes. When that happens, I stop following the list altogether and just start doing whatever pops into my head—which is the opposite of productivity.</p><p>Then, learning from this failure, I went in the other direction: making the list more structured.</p><h2 id="the-overcomplicated-system-that-failed">The Overcomplicated System That Failed</h2>
<p>This time, I categorized tasks with different statuses:</p><ul>
<li>Today’s Item – Must be done today.</li>
<li>Planned Item – Long-term task.</li>
<li>Good-To-Do Item – Nice if I can get to it, but not urgent.</li>
<li>Pending Review – Needs more thought before action.</li>
<li>Priority Shifted – Moved from “Today” to a future date.</li>
<li>Someday/Maybe – Vague ideas with no clear deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem? I kept focusing only on today’s items and ignored everything else. If I couldn’t finish something, I moved it to another category. At some point, I had so many categories that I didn’t even want to look at my list anymore.</p><p>Then, I made it even worse by splitting my list into two separate ones: <strong>Personal</strong> (groceries, cleaning, etc.) and <strong>Work</strong> (engineering tasks, antique business). This only added another layer of complexity.</p><p>I even used Notion to manage it all—but guess what? The system still didn’t work.</p><h2 id="the-simple-system-that-actually-works">The Simple System That Actually Works</h2>
<p>Now, let me introduce the method that’s saving my sanity.</p><p>It has only <strong>two sections</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>Thoughts/Plans – A brain dump of everything I’m thinking about or considering doing.</li>
<li>Actionable Items – Tasks that are ready to be executed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p><ul>
<li>I put all my ideas, plans, and thoughts in the first section.</li>
<li>When I’m <strong>ready to act</strong> on something, I move it to the second section.</li>
<li>Every day, I pick a few things from the actionable list and get them done. That’s it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-this-works">Why This Works</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No more overwhelming backlogs.</strong> If something stays too long in the “Thoughts/Plans” section and never moves to “Actionable Items,” it probably wasn’t something I needed to do in the first place. So, I delete it.</li>
<li><strong>Clear distinction between thinking and doing.</strong> Before, my to-do list was cluttered with vague ideas and long-term goals. Now, only things I can actually do are on my to-do list.</li>
<li><strong>Forces me to break big ideas into small, doable steps.</strong> If something stays in the thought section too long, I have to ask myself, “Can I break this into a smaller action?” If not, it probably belongs somewhere else.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-i-prefer-writing-it-down">Why I Prefer Writing It Down</h2>
<p>I also discovered that physically writing my to-do list works better than using digital tools. When I write things down, I can see everything at once. It’s like having a full view of my life and plans in one place—kind of like how people say reading physical books helps you remember information better than reading on an e-reader.</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m still tracking how well this system works in the long run, but for now, it feels like a game-changer. No more overwhelming lists, no more procrastination by overcomplication—just a simple way to stay focused and get things done.</p><p>If you’re struggling with to-do lists, give this method a try. It might just work for you too!</p>

                    Hey, I’m Hsucheng Huang, but most people know me as Aloma. I’m almost 40, living what most would call a “not bad” life—I have a decent job, a happy marriage, good health, and I’m mostly content. But… something bugs me. I like my job. I&hellip;

                <p>Hey, I’m Hsucheng Huang, but most people know me as Aloma. I’m almost 40, living what most would call a “not bad” life—I have a decent job, a happy marriage, good health, and I’m <em>mostly</em> content.  </p><p>But… something bugs me.  </p><hr>
<h2 id="the-struggle-i-want-to-build-something-that-truly-helps-people">The Struggle: I Want to Build Something That Truly Helps People</h2>
<p>I like my job. I really do. I work on a game editor that allows creators to build meaningful experiences, and that’s pretty cool. But deep down, I want to create something that <em>directly</em> improves people’s lives in a way that’s tangible and lasting.  </p><p>Not like Facebook or Twitter—tools that can be both good and bad. I want to build something that’s just <em>good</em>. Something like <a href="https://mylifenote.ai/"><strong>Lifenote</strong></a>, an amazing little tool built by a Taiwanese creator named <a href="https://x.com/danielwchen0">Daniel</a>. It helps me clear my mind and stay positive. I want to create something like that—something that genuinely helps people.  </p><h2 id="my-deepest-insecurity-financial-stability">My Deepest Insecurity: Financial Stability</h2>
<p>Another thing that’s been eating at me: my job isn’t <em>bad</em>, but what if one day, for some reason, I can’t work anymore? I want to build something that brings in stable income—even when I’m not actively working. Maybe that’s just my deep-seated insecurity, but it’s there.  </p><p>To be clear, it’s not like I’m making a ton of money right now. My income as an engineer is slightly below average. But what I <em>do</em> have is flexibility, and if I had to choose between <strong>money</strong> and <strong>freedom</strong>, I’d always choose freedom.  </p><p>But now that I’m getting older, I want both. I want enough income to make sure my partner and I are financially secure. And that’s where my next struggle begins.  </p><h2 id="the-antique-business-exciting-exhausting-and-everything-in-between">The Antique Business: Exciting, Exhausting, and Everything in Between</h2>
<p>Aside from my job, I’m also helping my partner grow his antique business in France. And honestly? It’s <em>fun</em>. The thrill of hunting down rare pieces, tracing their origins, and finding them a new home—it’s exciting.  </p><p>But let’s be real: it’s also <strong>a lot of work</strong>. Finding inventory, managing logistics, dealing with packaging—it’s not all glamour. I mostly handle the <strong>marketing and IT</strong> side of things. I even built an app for us to track what we buy and sell, making accounting easier. But I want to expand it, turn it into something more powerful. Maybe I’ll document that process here too.  </p><h2 id="oh-and-im-an-immigrant-in-france">Oh, and I’m an Immigrant in France</h2>
<p>I was born in Taiwan and moved to France two years ago. That in itself is a whole other journey—figuring out life in a new country, adapting to a different culture, navigating bureaucracy (which, if you’ve dealt with French paperwork, you <em>know</em> is an adventure).  </p><p>Maybe I’ll write about that too.  </p><h2 id="why-follow-this-blog">Why Follow This Blog?</h2>
<p>If you’re into <strong>real talk</strong> from a middle-aged guy trying to figure out his next move, this is the place. You’ll see me navigating my <strong>midlife identity crisis</strong>—shifting from full-time programmer to solopreneur, growing an antique business in France, and <em>hopefully</em> building something meaningful along the way.  </p><p>And hey, if any of this resonates with you, maybe we can grab a coffee someday. ☕  </p><h2 id="keeping-it-real-but-also-trying-to-stay-positive">Keeping It Real (But Also Trying to Stay Positive)</h2>
<p>I’m not a naturally super positive person. I try. I read a lot because I find energy from authors who inspire me. But I also don’t want to fake it.  </p><p>In real life, people think I’m happy because I smile a lot. But honestly? That’s just me being <strong>socially trained</strong>. Here, I want to be real. No forced positivity, no pretending to be ultra-energetic—just honest reflections.  </p><p>That said, I <em>probably</em> have to be a bit more upbeat on Twitter or other social platforms, because let’s be real—nobody wants to follow someone who’s just ranting about life all the time, right?  </p><hr>
<p>So that’s me. Confused, lost, but figuring it out. Stick around if you want to follow along. 🚀  </p>

                <p>This year, I’m attempting something radical: actually doing the things I think about. Novel concept, right?  </p><hr>
<h2 id="the-eternal-struggle-of-thinking-vs-doing">The Eternal Struggle of Thinking vs. Doing</h2>
<p>My brain? A nonstop idea factory. Business plans, creative projects, self-improvement schemes—I dream them up like it’s my job. And in those fleeting moments, I <em>genuinely</em> believe I’m about to change my life.  </p><p>Reality check: I’m probably still in bed, phone in hand, scrolling, convincing myself that <em>thinking</em> about doing something is basically the same as <em>doing</em> it.<br>Spoiler: it’s not.  </p><h2 id="the-lightbulb-moment">The Lightbulb Moment</h2>
<p>Then one day, mid-procrastination spiral, a phrase popped into my head: <strong>unity of thought and action.</strong>  </p><p>Maybe that’s what I need—not just grand ideas, not just impulsive action, but the two working together.  </p><h2 id="the-other-extreme-doing-without-thinking">The Other Extreme: Doing Without Thinking</h2>
<p>To be fair, I don’t <em>only</em> overthink—I also occasionally dive headfirst into action without much strategy. The result?  </p><ul>
<li>Wasted energy on things that don’t matter  </li>
<li>A to-do list full of half-finished projects  </li>
<li>The realization that enthusiasm alone doesn’t equal progress</li>
</ul>
<p>So for me, real <strong>unity of thought and action</strong> isn’t about acting on every whim—it’s about thinking clearly <em>before</em> acting, then actually following through.   </p><h2 id="this-blog-as-my-hopefully-helpful-nudge">This Blog as My (Hopefully) Helpful Nudge</h2>
<p>Since my brain likes to trick me into feeling productive when I’m just thinking, I need something to keep me honest. Writing it all down feels like a small step, but maybe small steps are enough to start.  </p><p>By putting my thoughts out here, I hope to:  </p><ol>
<li>Turn vague ideas into something real  </li>
<li>Share them with <em>actual people</em> (not just the inside of my head)  </li>
<li>Create a little accountability—because if I say it out loud, I <em>should</em> probably try to do it</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="keep-me-accountable-okay">Keep Me Accountable, Okay?</h2>
<p>So, if you’re reading this—congrats, you’re now part of my anti-procrastination support group. No pressure, but feel free to call me out if I start overthinking again.  </p><p>Let’s see if I can turn all these thoughts into something real. 🚀  </p>

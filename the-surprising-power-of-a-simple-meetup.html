I had signed up for a <strong>bi-weekly coworking meetup in Lyon</strong>, a gathering of digital nomads I found through the Meetup app.</p><p>But as the first session approached, doubt kicked in.<br>Would I have anything to say?<br>Would people be friendly?<br>Would it even be worth it?</p><p>I almost didn’t go. But I’m glad I did—because, honestly, it changed everything.</p><hr><h2 id="the-reluctance-why-its-hard-to-show-up">The Reluctance: Why It’s Hard to Show Up</h2><p>I’ve always worked best alone. Or at least, that’s what I thought.<br>Solopreneur, indie dev, antique seller—it’s easy to stay in my own bubble.</p><p>But the problem with working alone is that sometimes… nothing gets done.<br>For weeks, I had been <strong>putting off</strong> finishing my husband’s website. I kept telling myself I’d do it “soon.” Except <em>soon</em> never came.</p><p>Then, I showed up at this meetup.</p><h2 id="the-unexpected-push-of-coworking">The Unexpected Push of Coworking</h2><p>At first, it was just nice to be around other people working. The quiet focus, the sound of typing, the occasional conversation—it was a good energy.</p><p>But something weird happened: <strong>I started feeling accountable.</strong><br>Not in a stressful way, but in a <em>good</em> way.</p><p>I saw people working hard on their own projects, sharing ideas, making progress. And suddenly, I felt this unspoken pressure—<br><strong>If they’re doing it, why am I not?</strong></p><p>So I opened up my laptop.<br>I started working on the website I had been avoiding.<br>And before I knew it? <strong>It was done.</strong></p><p>Just showing up, sitting with other motivated people, and absorbing the energy was enough to <strong>snap me out of procrastination</strong>.</p><h2 id="more-than-just-productivitynew-ideas">More Than Just Productivity—New Ideas</h2><p>The effects didn’t stop there.<br>Since I had already finished the website, I had no excuse <em>not</em> to work on my own project—the one I’ve been slowly shaping in my head.</p><p>But here’s the thing: <strong>I thought I had everything figured out.</strong><br>Turns out, I didn’t.</p><p>Talking to people at the meetup <strong>helped me see things I had completely missed.</strong></p><ul><li>They asked questions I hadn’t thought about.</li><li>They pointed out potential challenges.</li><li>They even suggested ideas that made my system design <em>way</em> better.</li></ul><p>It was the kind of input you <em>can’t</em> get when you’re just thinking alone.</p><h2 id="from-meetup-to-ai-discussions">From Meetup to AI Discussions</h2><p>With these fresh perspectives, I went back to brainstorming—with AI.<br>I started breaking down the design using tools like <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and <strong>Grok-3</strong>, refining ideas I wouldn’t have even considered before.</p><p>And now?</p><ul><li>My <strong>system design is almost done.</strong></li><li>I’ve started doing <strong>UI/UX research</strong> and already have a simple direction.</li><li>I’m <strong>preparing to build the first prototype</strong> soon.</li></ul><p>Would any of this have happened if I hadn’t gone to that first meetup?<br>Honestly, <strong>probably not.</strong></p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><p>I never expected something as simple as a <strong>coworking meetup</strong> to make such a difference.<br>But now, every two weeks, I show up.<br>Not because I <em>have</em> to, but because I <em>want</em> to.</p><p>It’s the perfect mix of motivation, inspiration, and accountability—just enough pressure to <strong>keep me moving forward</strong>.</p><p>So if you’ve ever felt stuck, or if you’re working alone and struggling to push through—find a meetup.<br>Show up once.<br>See what happens.</p><p>It might just change everything. 🚀</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 4, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://alomahuang.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://alomahuang.com/what-i-am-who-i-am-and-whats-my-problem-2.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://alomahuang.com/media/posts/8/responsive/sonia-jahandari-Iz_dQ_t_9HE-unsplash-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1698" width="1698"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> My New Method for Balancing Full-Time job and Solopreneurship (Without Losing My Mind)</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2025 Aloma.

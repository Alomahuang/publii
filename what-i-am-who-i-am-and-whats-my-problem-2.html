Either they were too simple and led to chaos, or they were overcomplicated and became more of a burden than a tool. But after years of trial and error, I think I’ve finally cracked the code.</p><hr><h2 id="the-problem-with-traditional-to-do-lists">The Problem with Traditional To-Do Lists</h2><p>At first, I tried a basic to-do list. Just a simple list of tasks. Sounds great, right?</p><ul><li>Day 1: Everything gets done. Perfect.</li><li>Day 2: Almost everything gets done. Still fine.</li><li>Day 3 and beyond: Unfinished tasks start accumulating. The backlog grows.</li></ul><p>Eventually, the system collapses under the weight of all the unchecked boxes. When that happens, I stop following the list altogether and just start doing whatever pops into my head—which is the opposite of productivity.</p><p>Then, learning from this failure, I went in the other direction: making the list more structured.</p><h2 id="the-overcomplicated-system-that-failed">The Overcomplicated System That Failed</h2><p>This time, I categorized tasks with different statuses:</p><ul><li>Today’s Item – Must be done today.</li><li>Planned Item – Long-term task.</li><li>Good-To-Do Item – Nice if I can get to it, but not urgent.</li><li>Pending Review – Needs more thought before action.</li><li>Priority Shifted – Moved from “Today” to a future date.</li><li>Someday/Maybe – Vague ideas with no clear deadline.</li></ul><p>The problem? I kept focusing only on today’s items and ignored everything else. If I couldn’t finish something, I moved it to another category. At some point, I had so many categories that I didn’t even want to look at my list anymore.</p><p>Then, I made it even worse by splitting my list into two separate ones: <strong>Personal</strong> (groceries, cleaning, etc.) and <strong>Work</strong> (engineering tasks, antique business). This only added another layer of complexity.</p><p>I even used Notion to manage it all—but guess what? The system still didn’t work.</p><h2 id="the-simple-system-that-actually-works">The Simple System That Actually Works</h2><p>Now, let me introduce the method that’s saving my sanity.</p><p>It has only <strong>two sections</strong>:</p><ol><li>Thoughts/Plans – A brain dump of everything I’m thinking about or considering doing.</li><li>Actionable Items – Tasks that are ready to be executed.</li></ol><p>Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>I put all my ideas, plans, and thoughts in the first section.</li><li>When I’m <strong>ready to act</strong> on something, I move it to the second section.</li><li>Every day, I pick a few things from the actionable list and get them done. That’s it.</li></ul><h2 id="why-this-works">Why This Works</h2><ul><li><strong>No more overwhelming backlogs.</strong> If something stays too long in the “Thoughts/Plans” section and never moves to “Actionable Items,” it probably wasn’t something I needed to do in the first place. So, I delete it.</li><li><strong>Clear distinction between thinking and doing.</strong> Before, my to-do list was cluttered with vague ideas and long-term goals. Now, only things I can actually do are on my to-do list.</li><li><strong>Forces me to break big ideas into small, doable steps.</strong> If something stays in the thought section too long, I have to ask myself, “Can I break this into a smaller action?” If not, it probably belongs somewhere else.</li></ul><h2 id="why-i-prefer-writing-it-down">Why I Prefer Writing It Down</h2><p>I also discovered that physically writing my to-do list works better than using digital tools. When I write things down, I can see everything at once. It’s like having a full view of my life and plans in one place—kind of like how people say reading physical books helps you remember information better than reading on an e-reader.</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><p>I’m still tracking how well this system works in the long run, but for now, it feels like a game-changer. No more overwhelming lists, no more procrastination by overcomplication—just a simple way to stay focused and get things done.</p><p>If you’re struggling with to-do lists, give this method a try. It might just work for you too!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on February 13, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://alomahuang.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://alomahuang.com/what-i-am-who-i-am-and-whats-my-problem.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://alomahuang.com/media/posts/4/responsive/ethan-sykes-TdM_fhzmWog-unsplash-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="3297" width="3297"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> What I Am, Who I Am, and What’s My Problem  </div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://alomahuang.com/the-surprising-power-of-a-simple-meetup.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The Surprising Power of a Simple Meetup  </div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://alomahuang.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Ying-Mu-Xie-Qu-Hua-Mian-2025-03-04-143817-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="757" width="757"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2025 Aloma.

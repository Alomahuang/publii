I’m almost 40, living what most would call a “not bad” life—I have a decent job, a happy marriage, good health, and I’m <em>mostly</em> content.</p><p>But… something bugs me.</p><h2 id="the-struggle-i-want-to-build-something-that-truly-helps-people">The Struggle: I Want to Build Something That Truly Helps People</h2><p>I like my job. I really do. I work on a game editor that allows creators to build meaningful experiences, and that’s pretty cool. But deep down, I want to create something that <em>directly</em> improves people’s lives in a way that’s tangible and lasting.</p><p>Not like Facebook or Twitter—tools that can be both good and bad. I want to build something that’s just <em>good</em>. Something like <a href="https://mylifenote.ai/"><strong>Lifenote</strong></a>, an amazing little tool built by a Taiwanese creator named <a href="https://x.com/danielwchen0">Daniel</a>. It helps me clear my mind and stay positive. I want to create something like that—something that genuinely helps people.</p><h2 id="my-deepest-insecurity-financial-stability">My Deepest Insecurity: Financial Stability</h2><p>Another thing that’s been eating at me: my job isn’t <em>bad</em>, but what if one day, for some reason, I can’t work anymore? I want to build something that brings in stable income—even when I’m not actively working. Maybe that’s just my deep-seated insecurity, but it’s there.</p><p>To be clear, it’s not like I’m making a ton of money right now. My income as an engineer is slightly below average. But what I <em>do</em> have is flexibility, and if I had to choose between <strong>money</strong> and <strong>freedom</strong>, I’d always choose freedom.</p><p>But now that I’m getting older, I want both. I want enough income to make sure my partner and I are financially secure. And that’s where my next struggle begins.</p><h2 id="the-antique-business-exciting-exhausting-and-everything-in-between">The Antique Business: Exciting, Exhausting, and Everything in Between</h2><p>Aside from my job, I’m also helping my partner grow his antique business in France. And honestly? It’s <em>fun</em>. The thrill of hunting down rare pieces, tracing their origins, and finding them a new home—it’s exciting.</p><p>But let’s be real: it’s also <strong>a lot of work</strong>. Finding inventory, managing logistics, dealing with packaging—it’s not all glamour. I mostly handle the <strong>marketing and IT</strong> side of things. I even built an app for us to track what we buy and sell, making accounting easier. But I want to expand it, turn it into something more powerful. Maybe I’ll document that process here too.</p><h2 id="oh-and-im-an-immigrant-in-france">Oh, and I’m an Immigrant in France</h2><p>I was born in Taiwan and moved to France two years ago. That in itself is a whole other journey—figuring out life in a new country, adapting to a different culture, navigating bureaucracy (which, if you’ve dealt with French paperwork, you <em>know</em> is an adventure).</p><p>Maybe I’ll write about that too.</p><h2 id="why-follow-this-blog">Why Follow This Blog?</h2><p>If you’re into <strong>real talk</strong> from a middle-aged guy trying to figure out his next move, this is the place. You’ll see me navigating my <strong>midlife identity crisis</strong>—shifting from full-time programmer to solopreneur, growing an antique business in France, and <em>hopefully</em> building something meaningful along the way.</p><p>And hey, if any of this resonates with you, maybe we can grab a coffee someday. ☕</p><h2 id="keeping-it-real-but-also-trying-to-stay-positive">Keeping It Real (But Also Trying to Stay Positive)</h2><p>I’m not a naturally super positive person. I try. I read a lot because I find energy from authors who inspire me. But I also don’t want to fake it.</p><p>In real life, people think I’m happy because I smile a lot. But honestly? That’s just me being <strong>socially trained</strong>. Here, I want to be real. No forced positivity, no pretending to be ultra-energetic—just honest reflections.</p><p>That said, I <em>probably</em> have to be a bit more upbeat on Twitter or other social platforms, because let’s be real—nobody wants to follow someone who’s just ranting about life all the time, right?</p><hr><p>So that’s me. Confused, lost, but figuring it out. Stick around if you want to follow along. 🚀</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on February 12, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://alomahuang.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://alomahuang.com/unity-of-thought-and-action-or-trying-to-actually-do-things.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://alomahuang.com/media/posts/3/responsive/jeremy-bishop-4xXIX_qFy3c-unsplash-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="3648" width="3648"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Unity of Thought and Action (Or, Trying to Actually Do Things)</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2025 Aloma.

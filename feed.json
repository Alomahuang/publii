            "content_html": "<p>Hey, I’m Hsucheng Huang, but most people know me as Aloma. I’m almost 40, living what most would call a “not bad” life—I have a decent job, a happy marriage, good health, and I’m <em>mostly</em> content.  </p><p>But… something bugs me.  </p><h2 id=\"the-struggle-i-want-to-build-something-that-truly-helps-people\">The Struggle: I Want to Build Something That Truly Helps People</h2>\n<p>I like my job. I really do. I work on a game editor that allows creators to build meaningful experiences, and that’s pretty cool. But deep down, I want to create something that <em>directly</em> improves people’s lives in a way that’s tangible and lasting.  </p><p>Not like Facebook or Twitter—tools that can be both good and bad. I want to build something that’s just <em>good</em>. Something like <a href=\"https://mylifenote.ai/\"><strong>Lifenote</strong></a>, an amazing little tool built by a Taiwanese creator named <a href=\"https://x.com/danielwchen0\">Daniel</a>. It helps me clear my mind and stay positive. I want to create something like that—something that genuinely helps people.  </p><h2 id=\"my-deepest-insecurity-financial-stability\">My Deepest Insecurity: Financial Stability</h2>\n<p>Another thing that’s been eating at me: my job isn’t <em>bad</em>, but what if one day, for some reason, I can’t work anymore? I want to build something that brings in stable income—even when I’m not actively working. Maybe that’s just my deep-seated insecurity, but it’s there.  </p><p>To be clear, it’s not like I’m making a ton of money right now. My income as an engineer is slightly below average. But what I <em>do</em> have is flexibility, and if I had to choose between <strong>money</strong> and <strong>freedom</strong>, I’d always choose freedom.  </p><p>But now that I’m getting older, I want both. I want enough income to make sure my partner and I are financially secure. And that’s where my next struggle begins.  </p><h2 id=\"the-antique-business-exciting-exhausting-and-everything-in-between\">The Antique Business: Exciting, Exhausting, and Everything in Between</h2>\n<p>Aside from my job, I’m also helping my partner grow his antique business in France. And honestly? It’s <em>fun</em>. The thrill of hunting down rare pieces, tracing their origins, and finding them a new home—it’s exciting.  </p><p>But let’s be real: it’s also <strong>a lot of work</strong>. Finding inventory, managing logistics, dealing with packaging—it’s not all glamour. I mostly handle the <strong>marketing and IT</strong> side of things. I even built an app for us to track what we buy and sell, making accounting easier. But I want to expand it, turn it into something more powerful. Maybe I’ll document that process here too.  </p><h2 id=\"oh-and-im-an-immigrant-in-france\">Oh, and I’m an Immigrant in France</h2>\n<p>I was born in Taiwan and moved to France two years ago. That in itself is a whole other journey—figuring out life in a new country, adapting to a different culture, navigating bureaucracy (which, if you’ve dealt with French paperwork, you <em>know</em> is an adventure).  </p><p>Maybe I’ll write about that too.  </p><h2 id=\"why-follow-this-blog\">Why Follow This Blog?</h2>\n<p>If you’re into <strong>real talk</strong> from a middle-aged guy trying to figure out his next move, this is the place. You’ll see me navigating my <strong>midlife identity crisis</strong>—shifting from full-time programmer to solopreneur, growing an antique business in France, and <em>hopefully</em> building something meaningful along the way.  </p><p>And hey, if any of this resonates with you, maybe we can grab a coffee someday. ☕  </p><h2 id=\"keeping-it-real-but-also-trying-to-stay-positive\">Keeping It Real (But Also Trying to Stay Positive)</h2>\n<p>I’m not a naturally super positive person. I try. I read a lot because I find energy from authors who inspire me. But I also don’t want to fake it.  </p><p>In real life, people think I’m happy because I smile a lot. But honestly? That’s just me being <strong>socially trained</strong>. Here, I want to be real. No forced positivity, no pretending to be ultra-energetic—just honest reflections.  </p><p>That said, I <em>probably</em> have to be a bit more upbeat on Twitter or other social platforms, because let’s be real—nobody wants to follow someone who’s just ranting about life all the time, right?  </p><hr>\n<p>So that’s me. Confused, lost, but figuring it out. Stick around if you want to follow along. 🚀  </p>",

Novel concept, right?  </p><h2 id=\"the-eternal-struggle-of-thinking-vs-doing\">The Eternal Struggle of Thinking vs. Doing</h2>\n<p>My brain? A nonstop idea factory. Business plans, creative projects, self-improvement schemes—I dream them up like it’s my job. And in those fleeting moments, I <em>genuinely</em> believe I’m about to change my life.  </p><p>Reality check: I’m probably still in bed, phone in hand, scrolling, convincing myself that <em>thinking</em> about doing something is basically the same as <em>doing</em> it.<br>Spoiler: it’s not.  </p><h2 id=\"the-lightbulb-moment\">The Lightbulb Moment</h2>\n<p>Then one day, mid-procrastination spiral, a phrase popped into my head: <strong>unity of thought and action.</strong>  </p><p>Maybe that’s what I need—not just grand ideas, not just impulsive action, but the two working together.  </p><h2 id=\"the-other-extreme-doing-without-thinking\">The Other Extreme: Doing Without Thinking</h2>\n<p>To be fair, I don’t <em>only</em> overthink—I also occasionally dive headfirst into action without much strategy. The result?  </p><ul>\n<li>Wasted energy on things that don’t matter  </li>\n<li>A to-do list full of half-finished projects  </li>\n<li>The realization that enthusiasm alone doesn’t equal progress</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So for me, real <strong>unity of thought and action</strong> isn’t about acting on every whim—it’s about thinking clearly <em>before</em> acting, then actually following through.   </p><h2 id=\"this-blog-as-my-hopefully-helpful-nudge\">This Blog as My (Hopefully) Helpful Nudge</h2>\n<p>Since my brain likes to trick me into feeling productive when I’m just thinking, I need something to keep me honest. Writing it all down feels like a small step, but maybe small steps are enough to start.  </p><p>By putting my thoughts out here, I hope to:  </p><ol>\n<li>Turn vague ideas into something real  </li>\n<li>Share them with <em>actual people</em> (not just the inside of my head)  </li>\n<li>Create a little accountability—because if I say it out loud, I <em>should</em> probably try to do it</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"keep-me-accountable-okay\">Keep Me Accountable, Okay?</h2>\n<p>So, if you’re reading this—congrats, you’re now part of my anti-procrastination support group. No pressure, but feel free to call me out if I start overthinking again.  </p><p>Let’s see if I can turn all these thoughts into something real. 🚀  </p>",
